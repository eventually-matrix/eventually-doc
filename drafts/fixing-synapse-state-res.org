* Fixing Synapse "state resets" ([[https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1953][Synapse issue 1953]])
  Current as of commit [[https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/632baf799ea876d2346e934dce90d6a24cb92e37][632baf7]]
** Root cause is lack of transitive reduction despite reliance on it as invariant
*** TODO Implement transitive reduction of subset of DAG
**** Can be done in =O(nm)= time
     Where
     - =n= :: number of events
     - =m= :: "depth span" of events (max difference in depth)
**** Maybe reduce the number of events to look at by using only previous *state* events?
*** Places where invariant is known to be broken
**** TODO ~compute_event_context~ in ~synapse/state.py~
***** TODO Add a call to transitive reduction function before calling ~resolve_state_groups~
      Line 236
** TODO Ensure testing covers state resolution
*** TODO Add tests if necessary
**** TODO Investigate whether Synapse currently has failing tests for state resolution
*** TODO Test for backwards compatibility with previous Synapse versions
